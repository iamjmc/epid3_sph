### Lab 2 - causality & dags
You are interested in assessing whether physical activity( exposure) is causally related to heart disease (outcome). 
1. What other variables would you want to include in your DAG? Create a DAG with these variables and identify variables needed for total and direct effects?
```{r}
library(dagitty)
g <- dagitty('
dag {
"wall mold" [pos="-0.433,-0.322"]
age [pos="0.846,0.050"]
asthma [outcome,pos="0.341,-0.153"]
education [pos="-0.435,0.122"]
exercise [pos="0.324,0.355"]
howlonginUS [pos="-1.692,-0.427"]
race [pos="-0.569,-0.519"]
secondhandsmoker [pos="-0.031,0.869"]
smoker [pos="-0.903,0.620"]
usborn [exposure,pos="-1.195,-0.148"]
"wall mold" -> asthma
age -> asthma
age -> exercise
asthma -> exercise
education -> asthma
education -> exercise
education -> secondhandsmoker

howlonginUS -> "wall mold"

#Adjusting for direct effects = Age, BMI, Diet, Gender, SES

### Lab 3- Hypothesis Testing, Model Development, and Presentation of Results
Just a note: borough would require a DUA and currently not available. The variables noisetraffic, and badairwarning do not exist in CHS19. I use Wall Mold
